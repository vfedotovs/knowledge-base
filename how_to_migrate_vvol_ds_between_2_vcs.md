Migrating the same vVol datastore between two vCenter Servers requires careful planning. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

Prerequisites

Both vCenter Servers must be able to access the same vVol storage.

Ensure that the storage provider (VASA) is registered in both vCenters.

Verify that your storage system supports vVol migration between vCenters.

Check for vSphere compatibility (vSphere 7.0+ recommended).


Steps to Migrate vVol Datastore Between vCenters

1. Register the Storage Provider in the Destination vCenter

In vCenter Server A, navigate to vSphere Client > Storage Providers and note the details.

In vCenter Server B, register the same storage provider (VASA) under vSphere Client > Storage > Storage Providers.


2. Create the Same vVol Datastore in vCenter B

Add the same vVol storage container to vCenter Server B.

Ensure the same storage policy is applied.


3. Migrate Virtual Machines Using Cross-vCenter vMotion

Right-click the VM in vCenter A > Migrate.

Select Cross vCenter vMotion.

Choose Change compute resource only or Change both compute resource and storage.

Select the host/cluster in vCenter B and assign the same vVol datastore.

Complete the migration.


4. Remove the vVol Datastore from vCenter A (If Needed)

Once all VMs are migrated, remove the vVol datastore from vCenter A if it is no longer needed.


Considerations

Ensure network connectivity between vCenters.

Validate storage policies and compatibility before migration.

Check licensing requirements for cross-vCenter vMotion.
